After getting permission that is quite difficult to obtain, finally I can share this font for you all. And also they asked me to write a message from them. A lot of time consuming to translate their message which is also written with this font. And this is what their message says:

==============================================================================================
Dear Humans,

Greetings from Digital World. We are the guardians that also known as Royal Knights. We have a mission to keep the digital world peace. We understand that you human beings can never be separated from the name of technology. One of the technologies you use is the computer. We are all in charge of maintaining the flow of data. For us, each data byte is a life that must be protected.
We communicate with each other using special language and special writing. Which you know as Digicode or Digiletters. And one of you begged us to ask for the writing. We approve the request. Because we understand that you humans also want to know what life is like in the Digital World. Indeed our world is still full of mysteries that have not been known by many humans. We can not tell you everything that's inside the Digital World. In addition to our oath as the guardian of the Digital World, we are also more concerned about the safety and security of any data in the Digital World.
Not all humans have this special approval. But this begging man has made an agreement with us that he will not divulge everything about the Digital World and its contents. He simply begs for our writing which is our communication tool as one of the proofs of our existence.
That's the message from us. In the name of Yggdrasill We would like to express our gratitude and thank you for reading our message.

Regards
Representative of Royal Knights

LOL :v
You can also see their real message on the font preview. Don't ask me how they know about our human punctuation and also our human language in English.
There is actually another version of this letter. Which is more complicated than this one. I'll upload it later.
And It is
